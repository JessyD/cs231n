    Structured SVM loss function, naive implementation (with loops).

    Inputs have dimension D, there are C classes, and we operate on minibatches

    - W: A numpy array of shape (D, C) containing weights.
    - X: A numpy array of shape (N, D) containing a minibatch of data.
    - y: A numpy array of shape (N,) containing training labels; y[i] = c means
      that X[i] has label c, where 0 <= c < C.
    - reg: (float) regularization strength
